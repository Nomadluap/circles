\hyperlink{namespace_circles}{Circles} \hyperlink{namespace_circles}{Circles} is a program which interacts with circle packings. This program is designed to aid in the exploration of approximation of Riemann mappings from a polygon to the complex unit disc.

The program is not currently feature-\/complete.



Above is a screenshot of \hyperlink{namespace_circles}{Circles} in action, performing a repack of the \textquotesingle{}owl\textquotesingle{} packing.

\subsection*{Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Supports circle packings in both standard euclidean and poincare-\/disc hyperbolic geometries
\item Support reading of p-\/files generated with \href{http://www.math.utk.edu/~kens/CirclePack/}{\tt Ken Stephenson\textquotesingle{}s Circle\+Pack tool}
\item Toggable view of circles, center marks, indicies, tangency lines, and disc boundary
\item Properties explorer to show properties of any circle
\item Supports extraction of geometric shapes from hexagon-\/tilings for repacking
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Building}

This program was built and tested with Q\+T 5.\+5.\+1 using the M\+I\+N\+G\+W4.\+9.\+2 32-\/bit kit on Windows. Compilation shoudl also succeed with the msvc2013 kit, or any kit that supports C++14 features.

Compatibility with other Q\+T-\/compatible compilers is not guaranteed, but should work just fine.

This program is still a work in progress.
